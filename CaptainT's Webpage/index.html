        <p>Jett Sentry's quiet morning shatters when a violent home invasion leaves his father dead and his mother kidnapped. Pulled into the ranks of Black Divison, Jett discovered Protocol Helix-a covert program designed to protect the children of global power players. Assigned to guard Izabella Lukens, he must navigate betrayal, imposters, and the return of Kaiser, the man who destroyed his family. Bloodlines isn't just the start of Jett's career-it's the moment his destiny is written in fire and shadow. </p>

         <p>Jett Sentry thought escort duty was routine - until a rain-soaked ambush turned Los Angeles into a war zone. Trapped with Izabella in a junkyard, hunted by snipers and gangs, their only escape was a battered electric Chevy that barley ran. Between firefights, close calls, and a cave confession he never meant to say out loud, Jett realizes survival isn't just about tactics. It's about trust, breaking rules, and admitting that sometimes, damn it, feelings are more dangerous than bullets.   </p>
         <a id="book3" href="SENTRY-Final/SENTRY_Hearts_in_the_Crossfire.pdf" download>DOWNLOAD - SENTRY: Hearts in the Crossfire (Book 3)</a>
         <p>Jett Sentry thought surviving a sniper ambush and a junkyard escape was the hard part. But dinner with Izabella's family proved just as dangerous - emotionally and tactically. As their bond deepens, Prototcol 39 looms over them like a damn curse. And then Kaiser Krüger resurfaces, scarred but unbroken. His return ingite chaos across EALA HQ, but this time, Jett swears it will be Kaiser's last. Hearts in the Crossfire is where love, loyalty, and vengeance collide - and where Jett learns that sometimes the most dangerous battlefield is the one at the dinner table.      </p>
          <a id="book4" href="SENTRY-Final/SENTRY_The_Hollow.pdf" download>DOWNLOAD - SENTRY: The Hollow (Book 4)</a>
          <p>Several years after Kaiser Krüger’s death, The Hollow needed a new leader. Eirk Krüger stepped up — not for power, but for something far more fragile: finding his missing wife, Anneliese. As he rebuilds The Hollow from ruins, every decision is tactical, every move calculated. But beneath the strategy lies grief, betrayal, and the damn truth that war doesn’t just take lives — it erases them. The Hollow is a story of survival, loyalty, and the painful cost of remembering what was stolen.</p>
         <a id="book5" href="SENTRY-Final/SENTRY_The_Great_Collapse.pdf" download> DOWNLOAD - SENTRY: The Great Collapse (Book 5)</a>
         <p>Jett Sentry has faced warlords, snipers, and betrayal — but nothing prepared him for this. When his son Izac is kidnapped by Agent Vex, the mission becomes personal in a way that shakes him to his core. HQ is sabotaged, allies fracture, and Kaiser’s shadow looms one last time. Every move Jett makes risks tearing apart what little remains of his world. The Great Collapse is not just a mission — it’s Jett’s desperate, damn fight to save his family, his legacy, and himself before everything crumbles for good.</p>
